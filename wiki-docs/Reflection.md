# Reflection

## Belbin Team Roles
At the start of the project, we found that our team members exhibited traits of the following [Belbin Team Roles](Belbin Team Roles).

The immediate strengths of this configuration was in the diversity of team roles. With at least one of each of a Chair, Plant and a Monitor Evaluator, we were able to form a balanced team as defined in COMP1911 Lecture 12 by Jill Duggleby.

The following strengths were also observed throughout the project:
* Our company workers were initiative in starting work on different sections of the project
* Company workers often delivered functionality ahead of schedule
* The Chair was able to effectively lead all team meetings and direct the group
* Our Resource Investigator showed passion for the project and countributed quality work
* The specialist was able to use problem-solving to tackle challenging back-end problems

However, Belbin Team Roles also highlight weaknesses observed across personality types, such as:
* Company Workers and Monitor Evaluators requiring clear goals
* Chairs offloading work to others
* Specialists working as individuals
* Plants refusing to accept others' ideas
* Resource Investigators working without a clear plan

The following precautions were taken to mitigate such weaknesses, ensuring that the team was functioning happily and effectively:
* Active discussion on group chats (Facebook Messenger, Discord) to ensure the work of individuals fit with others'
* Clearly defined phases to motivate the frequent release of deliverables 
* Regular group meetings to ensure the project is on track and the correct work is being done
* Role-switching to allow members to freely implement ideas that motivated them

Understanding each others' Belbin Team Roles greatly impacted the team's productivity, as members knew in advance how to accommodate for one another's strengths and weaknesses throughout development. This allowed the correct workloads to be given to each member.

## Working off-campus
### Tools and processes that functioned well
The move to off-campus development prompted us to explore new tools and processes, and make extensive use of our previously adopted methods to continue working on the project. A few of the tools and processes that functioned well off-campus are listed below.

Communication tools:
* **Facebook Messenger** was already the primary means of discussing and resolving issues, meaning communication about the project was just as efficient off-campus. 
* **Discord** voice chats were used for team meetings, promoting pair-programming through the flexibility of an online presence and allowing for more in-depth discussions with file sharing and the ability to browse the internet.

Software Engineering tools:
* **GitLab** provided many features that allowed the team to function effectively before moving off-campus, and tools such as version control, the issue tracker and the wiki helped the team stay on-track and contribute to the final product throughout the project.
* **Trello** was used to host our team scrum board from the start of the project, where the convenience of an online board allowed everyone to keep track of development.
* **VS Code** provided many tools to manage conflicts and validate code when merging branches with other teammates.
* **MySQL Workbench** allowed us to quickly import the latest version of the project database with ease.
* **Heroku** was used to publish our project and let anyone test the latest stable release.

Software Engineering processes:
* **Agile development** defined clear and achievable goals for each member, motivating continued development off-campus and constant improvement towards the final product.
* **Pair programming** over voice chat allowed us to quickly overcome challenges and develop code faster than if it were to be done individually.
* **Scrum boards** meant that features falling behind in development were easily identified and could be picked up by other members to ensure smooth progression of the project.

### Tools and processes that did not function well

The tools used for the project remained mostly unaffected by the move off-campus, as most of us were already contributing remotely towards the project through GitLab and Trello. However, a few issues were introduced to processes that limited their effectiveness:

* **Agile development** promotes a flexible development cycle where improvements are made at each iteration. Towards the end of the project, fewer tasks were due for completion and hence productivity dropped as less work needed to be done.
* **Group meetings** saw a drop in attendance, as it was harder to keep track of meetings off-campus since members had different timetables.

### Impact on the planned delivery of our product
Due to the unforseen circumstances, additional features such as a mobile app to accompany the website were not able to be completed, as members found it harder to find access to time and resources.

However, the use of tools and processes that accommodate remote development allowed many core features of the project to be finished according to plan. Since the project was ahead of schedule prior to moving off-campus, the team was able to complete most of what we had initially set out to do, as well as polish the look and feel of the final product in time for the project deadline.

## Design

A full requirements investigation was performed across the team, the findings from this process can be found below.

* [Observation](Iteration 1/Inception-Phase#observation)
* [UML Diagrams](Iteration 1/Inception-Phase#uml-diagrams)
* [UI Prototypes](Iteration 1/Inception-Phase#ui-prototypes)
* [Non-Functional Requirements](Iteration 1/Inception-Phase#non-functional-requirements)
* [Site Maps](Iteration 1/Inception-Phase#site-maps)
